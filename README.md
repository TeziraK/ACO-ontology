# ACO-ontology
ACO formalizes scientific knowledge discovery based on the Abductive Theory of Method (ATOM), which emphasizes a trajectory beginning with phenomenon detection and followed by the generation, development, and appraisal of explanatory theories to explain the said phenomena. 
ACO provides a structured, domain-independent representation of these abductive processes that can be specialized for different domains
